## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com//) - tailwind

### Continued development

This simple project became challenging because I worked with framework that I wasn't comfortable with. I learned a lot and I'll continue to push my boundary to learn new things.
